# Traffic-signal-system
This C++ program simulates a traffic signal system using the TrafficSignal class. It cycles through Red, Green, and Yellow signals with appropriate messages. The runSignalSystem() function runs 5 cycles, each with a 3-second delay before switching. It starts with Red (Stop), then Green (Go), and Yellow (Get Ready), mimicking real traffic lights.
